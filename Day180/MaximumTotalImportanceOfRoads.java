// 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads : https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-28


// You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
// You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.
// You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.
// Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.

// Example 1:


// Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
// Output: 43
// Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].
// - The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.
// - The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
// - The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.
// - The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.
// - The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.
// - The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.
// The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.
// It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.

// Example 2:


// Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// Output: 20
// Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [4,3,2,5,1].
// - The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
// - The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.
// - The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.
// The total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.
// It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.
 

// Constraints:

// 2 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 104
// roads[i].length == 2
// 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
// ai != bi
// There are no duplicate roads.
